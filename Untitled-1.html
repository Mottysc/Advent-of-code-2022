<code>head = (0,0)<br>
    tail = [(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)]<br>
    </code><br>
    I have tried to do this by using a for loop to iterate through the tail list and then using an if statement to check if the head is within one of the tail coordinates.<br>
    <code>for i in tail:<br>
        if head[0] &gt;= i[0] - 1 and head[0] &lt;= i[0] + 1 and head[1] &gt;= i[1] - 1 and head[1] &lt;= i[1] + 1:<br>
            print("True")<br>
        else:<br>
            print("False")<br>
    </code><br>
    This works for the first two coordinates in the tail list but not the third.<br>
    I have also tried to use a while loop to iterate through the tail list but I can't get it to work.<br>
    <code>i = 0<br>
    while i &lt; len(tail):<br>
        if head[0] &gt;= tail[i][0] - 1 and head[0] &lt;= tail[i][0] + 1 and head[1] &gt;= tail[i][1] - 1 and head[1] &lt;= tail[i][1] + 1:<br>
            print("True")<br>
        else:<br>
            print("False")<br>
        i += 1<br>
